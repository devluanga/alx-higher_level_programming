					0x02. Python - import & modules
 In Python, a module is a file that contains Python code. Modules can be used to organize code, to share code between different programs, and to avoid duplicating code.

To import a module, you use the import statement. The import statement tells Python to load the module into memory. Once a module is loaded, you can use the functions and variables that are defined in the module.

For example, the following code imports the math module and then uses the pi constant from the math module:
 

		import math
		print(math.pi)

This code will print the value of pi, which is approximately 3.14159.

Modules can be imported from a variety of sources, including the Python standard library, third-party libraries, and custom modules.

The Python standard library is a collection of modules that are included with Python. The standard library contains a wide variety of modules, including modules for math, string manipulation, file I/O, and networking.

Third-party libraries are modules that are created by other developers and are not included with Python. Third-party libraries can be found on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Custom modules are modules that you create yourself. Custom modules can be used to organize your code, to share code with others, and to avoid duplicating code.
