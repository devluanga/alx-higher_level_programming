Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. 

A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. 
It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. 
You can think of a class as a user-defined data type.

Here's an example of a simple class definition in Python:


	class Person:
	    def __init__(self, name, age):
	        self.name = name
	        self.age = age
	
	    def greet(self):
	        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")


In this example, we define a class named `Person`. 
It has two attributes: `name` and `age`, which are initialized in the `__init__` method. 
The `greet` method is a behavior associated with instances of the `Person` class, 
and it prints a greeting message using the instance's name and age.

To create an object (or instance) of the `Person` class, we can do the following:


	person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
	person2 = Person("Bob", 30)

Here, `person1` and `person2` are two distinct instances of the `Person` class. 

Each instance has its own `name` and `age` attributes.
We can access these attributes and call the `greet` method on each instance:


	print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice
	print(person2.age)   # Output: 30

	person1.greet()      # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.
	person2.greet()      # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I'm 30 years old.

In summary, a class defines a blueprint for creating objects, 
and objects (or instances) are specific instances of a class with their own set of attributes and behaviors.
