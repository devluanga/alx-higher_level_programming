JavaScript has three types of scope:

Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function are in the global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
Local scope: Variables declared inside a function are in the local scope. They are only accessible from within the function.
Block scope: Variables declared in a block of code (such as an if statement or a for loop) are in the block scope. They are only accessible from within the block of code.
Closures are functions that have access to variables from their enclosing scope, 
even after the enclosing scope has closed. 
This is because closures capture the variables from their enclosing scope when they are created.


Here is an example of a closure:

function makeCounter() {
  var counter = 0;

  function incrementCounter() {
    counter++;
    return counter;
  }

  return incrementCounter;
}

var counterFunction = makeCounter();
console.log(counterFunction()); // 1
console.log(counterFunction()); // 2



Closures are a powerful tool that can be used to create reusable functions and to implement object-oriented programming techniques in JavaScript.

Here are some of the uses of closures in JavaScript:

Creating reusable functions: Closures can be used to create reusable functions that can access data from their enclosing scope. This can be useful for functions that need to access state or configuration data.
Implementing object-oriented programming techniques: Closures can be used to implement object-oriented programming techniques in JavaScript. For example, closures can be used to create private methods and to implement inheritance.
Passing callbacks to event handlers: Closures can be used to pass callbacks to event handlers. This can be useful for event handlers that need to access data from their enclosing scope.
