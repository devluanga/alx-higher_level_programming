[200~Exceptions are a fundamental concept in Python that allow you to handle and manage errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. When an exceptional situation arises, an exception object is raised, and if not handled properly, it can result in program termination.

Python provides a variety of built-in exceptions that cover different types of errors, such as `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, and `FileNotFoundError`, among others. Additionally, you can also create your own custom exceptions by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class.

To handle exceptions, Python provides a mechanism called "try-except" blocks. By enclosing the code that may raise an exception within a try block, you can catch and handle specific exceptions in the corresponding except block. This allows you to gracefully handle errors and perform alternative actions or provide appropriate error messages.

Here's an example of using a try-except block to handle an exception:


		try:
			result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero raises ZeroDivisionError
				print(result)
				except ZeroDivisionError:
					print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
	    

	    In this example, the code within the try block attempts to perform a division by zero, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. The except block catches this exception and executes the code within it, printing an error message.

	    By using try-except blocks, you can prevent unexpected errors from crashing your program and handle them in a controlled manner. It allows you to gracefully recover from exceptional situations and maintain the stability and usability of your code.
